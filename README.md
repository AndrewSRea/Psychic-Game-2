A game which randomly picks a letter, and has the user guess which letter the game has chosen.

Rules:

1. Guess what letter the game is "thinking" by typing the letter on the keyboard.
2. Wins: will show the number of times the user has guessed the letter correctly.
3. Losses: will show the number of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses.
4. Guesses Left: will show the number of guesses the user has left.
5. Your Guesses So Far: will show the specific letters that the user has typed, and will display those letters until the user either wins or loses.
6. When the player wins, the "Wins" counter will increase and start the game over again.
7. When the player loses, the "Losses" counter will increase and restart the game.
